# Mapping_Earthquakes_Challenge

## Project Overview

1. Create a branch from the main branch on GitHub.
2. Add, commit, and push data to a GitHub branch.
3. Merge a branch with the main branch on GitHub.
4. Retrieve data from a GeoJSON file.
5. Make API requests to a server to host geographical maps.
6. Populate geographical maps with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and the 7. Data-Driven Documents (D3) library.
8. Add multiple map layers to geographical maps using Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls.
9. Use JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features, and interactivity to maps.
10. Render maps on a local server.

Software: JavaScript, VSCode, Gitbash, GeoJSON 

## Purpose

Build insightful data visuizations with interactive features on earthquakes from around the world for the earthquae disaster team. Pull current earthquake data from US geological survey and display earthquake size and strength, as well as fault lines on a map. An API call is made to record earthquakes that occured in the past week with magnitudes greater that 4.5 on the map. Finally, to show off layering techniques, an additional mapp was added in another Mapbox style. Users can toggler through the different layers of the map to view only the data they want to see. 

## Results 

Below are screen shots of some layers of the map. First, the tectonic plate fault lines were the first layer added. Next, the major earthquakes of the past week were added. Finally, a third map style was added in the way of night navigation. This display helps to highlight the colors of the earthquakes and fault lines. 


### Addition of Fault Lines
